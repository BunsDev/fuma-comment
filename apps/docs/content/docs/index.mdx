</Callout>

A less-configuration, flexible library that integrates a comment area into your blog. It doesn't handle Authentication, you can use your own Auth system with Fuma Comment (ex: integrates with Auth.js).

Note that it is not a SaaS, you will need a database (PostgreSQL & MySQL) to continue.

## Client

Currently, we only provide React.js client API. You have to pass authentication data into the component, there's an example for NextAuth.

```tsx
import { signIn } from "next-auth/react";
import { Comments } from "@fuma-comment/react";

export function CommentsWithAuth() {
  return (
    <Comments
      auth={{
        // function to sign in
        signIn: () => void signIn("github"),
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Styling

All components are pre-styled with Tailwind CSS, notice that it also normalizes your CSS ([Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight)).

```ts
import "@fuma-comment/react/style.css";
```

For projects using Tailwind CSS v4, use the Tailwind CSS preset instead:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@fuma-comment/react/preset.css";

/* path of the package relative to the CSS file */
@source '../node_modules/@fuma-comment/react/dist/**/*.js';
```

## Database

You need a database to persist comments. Fuma Comment has built-in support for Prisma ORM, you may implement your own storage adapter following the instructions in TSDoc of `StorageAdapter`.

### Prisma

First, update your schema to include following tables:

```prisma
// optional for Role System based on database
model Role {
  userId    String  @id @db.VarChar(256)
  name      String  @db.VarChar(256)
  canDelete Boolean
}

model Comment {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  page      String   @db.VarChar(256)
  thread    Int?
  author    String   @db.VarChar(256)
  content   Json     @db.Json
  timestamp DateTime @default(now()) @db.Timestamp()

  rates Rate[]

  @@index([page])
}

model Rate {
  userId    String  @db.VarChar(256)
  commentId Int
  like      Boolean

  comment Comment @relation(fields: [commentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@id([userId, commentId])
  @@index([commentId])
}
```

## Server

Fuma Comment supports several web/backend frameworks, including Next.js and Express.

### Next.js

Create `app/api/comments/[[...comment]]/route.ts`.

```ts title="app/api/comments/[[...comment]]/route.ts"
import { NextComment } from "@fuma-comment/next";
import { prisma } from "@/utils/database";
import { authOptions } from "@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options";
import { createPrismaAdapter } from "@fuma-comment/server/adapters/prisma";
import { createNextAuthAdapter } from "@fuma-comment/server/adapters/next-auth";

export const { GET, DELETE, PATCH, POST } = NextComment({
	mention: { enabled: true },
	auth: createNextAuthAdapter(authOptions),
	storage: createPrismaAdapter({
		db: prisma,
		auth: 'next-auth', // Use tables created by NextAuth
	}),
});
```

### Express

Pass your express app as a parameter, all the endpoints will be added under `/api/comments`.

```ts
import { ExressComment } from "@fuma-comment/server/express";

ExressComment({ app, adapter, getSession });
```
